//!
//! @description
//! This module contains the logic for calculating pot distribution in a poker game,
//! with a primary focus on correctly handling complex side pot scenarios. When players
//! go all-in with different stack sizes, multiple pots are created, and this logic
//! ensures each player is only eligible to win the portion of the pot they contributed to.
//!
//! @logic
//! 1. Player Data: Takes player bets and hand ranks as input.
//! 2. Side Pot Creation:
//!    - It identifies all unique all-in amounts from players.
//!    - It creates a series of pots (a main pot and potentially multiple side pots),
//!      with each pot capped at the next lowest all-in amount.
//! 3. Contribution Calculation: For each pot, it calculates how much each player
//!    contributes, up to the pot's cap.
//! 4. Winner Determination: For each individual pot, it identifies the winner(s)
//!    from the set of players who contributed to that specific pot.
//! 5. Payout Aggregation: The winnings from all pots are summed up for each player
//!    to determine their total payout for the hand.
//!
//! @dependencies
//! - `crate::logic::poker_evaluator::HandRank`: For comparing hand strengths.
//!
//! @notes
//! - This implementation uses fixed-size arrays and data-independent loops to ensure
//!   compatibility with the Arcis MPC environment.
